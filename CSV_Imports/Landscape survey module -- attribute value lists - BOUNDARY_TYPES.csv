Value,Info
Geomorphic feature extent,"Cultural deposits are exposed only across a specific geomorphic feature, with artefact density dropping significantly beyond the geomorphic feature boundary"
Mound margins,"Mound margins, demarcated by a visible increase in mound height in relation to adjacent substrate"
Reduction in artefact density,"Exposure of cultural materials is not constrained by the extent of a geomorphic feature, and thus the feature boundary reflects the real distribution of artefacts observed. Site boundary represents a significant decline in artefact numbers."
Extent of built feature,"Recorded boundary reflects the extent of a built feature (e.g. fenced area, structural foundations)"
Not recorded,No boundary recording was conducted due to the feature having a constrained extent (e.g. isolated artefact)
Not applicable,No boundary recording was conducted. Please specify why in annotation field
