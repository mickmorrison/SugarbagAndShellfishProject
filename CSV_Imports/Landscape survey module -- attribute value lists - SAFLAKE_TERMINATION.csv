Value,Info
Absent,Missing termination
Feather,"Minimal thickness at the distal end, and a very acute angle bewteen the dorsal and ventral surface"
Axial,When the crack forming the termination moves through the core at an approximate right angle
Hinge,"The fracture meets the core surface at an approximate right angle to the percussion axis of the flake, less abrupt than a step fracture, typically bending from the ventral to dorsal surface "
Step,"Flake is abruptly terminated with a right angled break, creating a distinctive step feature"
Plunging,"The fracture plane curves markedly away from the core and then back into the core, typically leaving a J shaped termination that bends from the dorsal "
