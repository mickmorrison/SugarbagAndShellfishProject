Clear,"Tangible evidence of-surface deposits, for example, where a section has been exposed that reveals cultural material, or where cultural materials are seen to be eroding from a portion of the feature (e.g. on a slope)"
High,"No unambiguous evidence of sub-surface deposits, but the characterstics of the landform (e.g. aggrading land surface) and local archaeology are highly suggestive of such deposits existing "
Low,"Sub-surface deposits are considered unlikely, due to the characterstics of the landform (e.g. badly eroded surface), but the potential for such deposits to occur can not be ruled out. "
None,"Situations where sub-surface deposits can be ruled out due to the landform characteristics (e.g. a substrate of bedrock, clay hardpan or, stones and rubble)"
